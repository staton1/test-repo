psql -c "select * from pg_stat_archiver"

1. u need a base backup (pg_basebackup -D /var/lib/pgsql/11/backups
select pg_switch_wal(); 
2 stop the cluster and delete everything in data director
3. ALTER SYSTEM SET archive_mode = on;
4. wal_level = replica';

   ALTER SYSTEM SET archive_command TO 'cp %p /var/lib/pgsql/11/archive/%f';
   ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '1GB';
   ALTER SYSTEM SET min_wal_size = '80MB';
4. archive_command
3. shut down cluster and delete  --cp -R /var/lib/pgsql/11/backups/*   am in my data directory
4. create a recovery.conf file toch recovery.conf (it is telling postgre that u are in a recovery state)
DELETE FROM ITECH.UNIVERSITY WHERE ID IN (SELECT ID FROM ITECH.UNIVERSITY LIMIT 5);

Point in Time Recovery  (select pg_current_wal_lsn(),pg_wafile_name(pg_current_wal_lsn()); )
	point in time recovery 

RPO : Recovery point objective (meaning the amount of data lost the company can acommodate crash at 10 am your you can recovery from 9;59 am

RTO : Recovery Time objective (meaning the amount of down time lost the company will accomandate your your cluser went down at 10am how much time do you have to restore
if your company RTO is 20miunte u have max of 20 minute to bring it backup

point in time recovery can be done in 3 ways

1. it can be done up to a specific time in that case the parameter we will use is (recovery_target_time)
2. it can be done upto a specific LSN Logical sequence number in this case we will use (recovery_target_lsn)
3. it can be done up to a specific restore point (recovery_target_name) the most common is recovery target tim


there are condition to meet before you can perform point in time recovery

1. your cluster must be in archive log mode
2. you must have a valid pg_basebackup


STEPS
select pg_start_backup('lable')(); and take a pgbasebackup
1. Check your log to know exactly at what time the cluster went down if your cluser went down at 10:02am you will know that recovery target time can be 10:01am
2. when you already know the time your cluser went down you need to delete everything from the data directory
3. restore from the backup location to the data directory
4. you will have to create a recovery.conf file.(the recovery.conf file tells the cluster that you are in recovery state)
5. in the recovery.conf file you will specify 
       restore_command: is pointing to the location of your archive logs
       recovery_target_time : is the date and time you want to recover from
       recovery_target_action: specify the action you want your server to take when recovery is done. 

for this you have 
PAUSE : If you specify recovery action to be pause your server will start up in ready only mode
PROMOTE: If you specify your server to be promote your server will be in read and write mode.
for PROMOTE and PAUSE the recovery.conf will rename itself to recovery.done when recovery is completed

DISABLE;if you specify your action to be disable your server will shutdown after recovery and the recovery will not rename itself you will have to rename manuel after recovery is done

If your cluser startup in read only mode, you need to issue select pg_wal_replay_resume(); to open in read and write mode.

your cluster will startup and recovery is complete.

stop the server
select pg_switch-wal;
we can ask postgres to always take log of ddl (log_statement ='all')
\! date
create a recovery.conf file : it is telling postgres that u are in recovery state.
